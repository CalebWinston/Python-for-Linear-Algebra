# Python-for-Linear-Algebra

A few code snippets for finding dot product and other functional linear algebra in python. 


```# Dot Product Python Code


# Find Dot Product
"""import numpy as np
X = [-5,3,2,8]
Y = [1,2,-1,0]
DotProduct = np.dot(X,Y)
print('Dot product is : ' , DotProduct)"""


#Numpy Find Array Size
"""import numpy as np
x = np.zeros((1,3,4,2), dtype=np.complex128)
x.size
print (x.size)"""

#Flat World
the_world_is_flat = 1
if the_world_is_flat:
    print ("Be careful! Don't fall off!")
```
